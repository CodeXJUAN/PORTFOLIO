At Lacetania, where I did my CGFM, I was taught the basics of computer science.

This is where I learned the most, especially because when I arrived I didn't know much about computers, only a little bit about web development because I taught myself a little bit before I went there.

The subjects that I did that I liked the most and that definitely helped me the most are these:

- Equipment Assembly and Maintenance
- Introduction to Operating Systems
  - Linux and Linux Servers
  - Windows and Windows Server
- Network Operating Systems
  - Active Directory, LDAP, DNS Server, DHCP Server and Web Server
- Office Applications
  - Microsoft Apps
  - Introduccion to Database Managment
- Networking
  - GNS3 or Packet Tracer
  - How to mount your own local network
  - Racks, Servers, Routers and Acces Points
- Secur
- Programming
  - Python
- Web Development
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - Introduction to JavaScript
